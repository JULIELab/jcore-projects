    "description": "This project is a resource for the JCoRe Linnaeus Annotator. The dictionaries contained herein are used\n        for the recognition of concrete species names in text, e.g. \"human\", \"mouse\", \"n.\n        furzeri\", \"c. elegans\" etc as well as species hints, i.e. indirect clues to a species like the\n        word \"patient\" which most likely refers to a human. Additionally to such rather clear proxies, this\n        project also includes a small dictionary containing maximum-frequency-proxies for genus expressions like \"Drosophila\"\n        which will be mapped to \"D. melanogaster\". For the task of only finding concrete species names in\n        text, there is the project jcore-linnaeus-species-ae-species-dict.\n    ",
