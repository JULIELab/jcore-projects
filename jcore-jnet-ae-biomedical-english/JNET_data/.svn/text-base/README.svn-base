The GENE-model contained in this PEAR package 
was trained on the PennBioIE corpus. The model distinguishes 
three different GENE entities: dna, rna, and a generic type.

For more information on the PennBioIE corpus, please refer to 
see http://bioie.ldc.upenn.edu/.

The training material (in the format JNET requires it) is 
in this folder as well (pennbio_genes.train.ppd). 

Using JNET, you might train your own models from different 
training material according to your application needs. Please 
refer to the JNET documentation for more detailed information on 
how to train a model.
